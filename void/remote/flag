There is something to be said about the _you did it_ star. That somehow, despite its childishly cartoonish aesthetics (or perhaps more likely, because of), the people _love_ it. Such is the appeal of modern art, the decomposition and unraveling of conventions, mocking it through ironic depictions, thus engendering sincerity. Sincerity? How could irony be a source of sincerity, you may ask. We as a society are so used to the insincere messages at the end of some grand service. The "thank you for choosing us" after the airline cancelled your plane and rebooked you for one 30 hours after, and the "great job!" on standard exams after you clearly bombed it. It is as if they don't actually care about the message. They are but blindly following the niceties of yesterday's, churning out phrases one after the other. Thus, the _you did it_ star stands as a beacon of sincerity and irony. The organizers know that most contestants probably didn't do as well as they hoped -- they didn't solve a problem despite their best efforts, they couldn't implement a solution before the time ran out, or they simply did worse than they wanted to. After all, there are only so many winners. Most don't stand out. So the _you did it_ star tells them: "It's ok! I know you probably didn't do so well, just like how I am not well-drawn. But it doesn't matter, because you had fun solving the problems, and ultimately this is just a silly contest. So regardless of what happened, _you_ did it, even if _you_ did not do it so well." But you may argue that the insincerity of the _you did it_ star is antithetical to all that the competition stands for, and that it completely defeats the effort that we, the competitors, put into solving challenges such as this. That we did not do it is besides the point, it is the fact that we failed that is important. But I disagree!!! Because _you_ did not do it!!!!!! Anywho, thanks for coming to my TED talk.
