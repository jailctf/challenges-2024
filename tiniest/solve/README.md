Perl's substitution+eval syntax `s///e` allows one to perform arbitrary `eval`, provided that you can generate a useful string. Because it's Perl, the `/` delimiter can actually be any character, so `s eeee` is also valid syntax and bypasses the restrictions. In order to build a string, we can use the version string syntax `v69` (synonymous with `chr 69`). Due to the limited charset, generating numbers is difficult, but can be done `eval`ing `1111...(42 ones)...1111`. This turns into `1.11111111111111e+41`. This is all you really need to generate and `eval` arbitrary strings, but very careful substitution work is necessary to fit everything in the right way such that it forms a valid Perl payload. See [payload.pl](payload.pl) for inspiration (although it probably isn't very helpful).
