# pickled magic

i checked which numpy submodules have import builtins so we can just get breakpoint or whatever and win (see [here](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Anumpy%2Fnumpy%20%2Fimport%20builtins%2F&type=code))

there are many ways to solve this but `numpy.ma.core.builtins.breakpoint` is what i happened to find first

see solve.py
